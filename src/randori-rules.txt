Randori Rules
=============

1.	If you have the keyboard, you get to decide what to type.
2.	If you have the keyboard and you don’t know what to type, ask for help.
3.	If you are asked for help, kindly respond to the best of your ability.
4.	If you are not asked, but you see an opportunity for improvement or learning, choose an appropriate moment to mention it. 
	This may involve waiting until the next time all the tests pass (for design improvement suggestions) or until the retrospective.
5.	Each person has 7 minutes to drive (have the keyboard).  At the end of the period, the group moves to the right one seat.
