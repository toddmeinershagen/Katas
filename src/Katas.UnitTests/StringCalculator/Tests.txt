String Calculator - Tests
=========================

* Try not to read ahead
* Do one task at a time.  The trick is to learn to work incrementally.
* There is no need to test for invalid inputs for this kata; assume string is correctly formatted.

1.  Create string calculator with method int Add(string numbers)
	a.  Can take 0, 1, or 2 numbers and will return the sum
		""		= 0
		"4"		= 4
		"4,5"	= 9
	b.  Start with simplest case and work up to the 2 numbers
	c.  Solve things as simply as possible
	d.  Refactor after each passing test (TDD::RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)

2.  Allow Add to handle unlimited number of numbers
4.  Support different delimiters
	a.  To change delimiter, beginning of string will contain a separator line
		"//[delimiter]\n[numbers...]"
		"//;\n1;2" = 3
	b.	The first line is optional, so should still support the other scenarios
5.	Call Add with negative numbers should throw an exception
	a.	Message should look like "Negatives are not allowed.  [n1,n2,n3]"
	b.  The numbers listed in the message are the ones that are negative.
